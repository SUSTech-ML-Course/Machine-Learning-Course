    "### Preparing the text data\n",
    "The data-set used here, is split into a training set and a test set containing 702 mails and 260 mails respectively, divided equally between spam and ham mails. You will easily recognize spam mails as it contains `spmsg` in its filename.\n",

    "In any text mining problem, text cleaning is the first step where we remove those words from the document which may not contribute to the information we want to extract. Emails may contain a lot of undesirable characters like punctuation marks, stop words, digits, etc which may not be helpful in detecting the spam email. The emails in Ling-spam corpus have been already preprocessed in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Removal of stop words** – Stop words like “and”, “the”, “of”, etc are very common in all English sentences and are not very meaningful in deciding spam or legitimate status, so these words have been removed from the emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lemmatization** – It is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. For example, “include”, “includes,” and “included” would all be represented as “include”. The context of the sentence is also preserved in lemmatization as opposed to stemming (another buzz word in text mining which does not consider meaning of the sentence)\n",
    "\n",
    "We still need to remove the non-words like punctuation marks or special characters from the mail documents. There are several ways to do it. Here, we will remove such words after creating a dictionary, which is a very convenient method to do so since when you have a dictionary; you need to remove every such word only once."

Suppose the text in the training file is “Get the work done, work done”, then it will be encoded as $$[0,0,0,0,0,…….0,0,2,0,0,0,……,0,0,1,0,0,…0,0,1,0,0,……2,0,0,0,0,0]$$ Here, all the word counts are placed at the 296th, 359th, 415th, 495th elements of the word count vector in the length of 500 and the rest are zero."
