    "\n",
    "The Silhouette Analysis can be used to study the separation distance between the resulting clusters. It displays a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation) and can thus be used to assess the number of clusters k. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Compute the average distance between all data points in one cluster $C_i$\n",

    "\n",
    ">The $min$ is used, because we want to know the average distance to the closed cluster $i$ is not a member of.\n",
    "\n",
    "With $a$ and $b$ we can now calculate the silhouette coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s\\left(i\\right)=\\frac{b\\left(i\\right)-a\\left(i\\right)}{max\\{a\\left(i\\right),b\\left(i\\right)\\}}, if |C_i|>1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient can take values in the interval $[-1, 1]$. Zero means the sample is very close to the neighboring clusters. One means the sample is far away from the neighboring cluster, and negative one means the sample is probably assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "KMeans is an easy-to-implement algorithm that is also quite fast with an average complexity of $O(k*n*T)$, where n is the number of samples, and T is the number of iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drawbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, KMeans makes use of the **sum-of-squares criterion**, which works well if the clusters have a spherical-like shape. It doesn't work well on many other types of data like complicated shapes, though. In this section, we'll go over a few cases where KMeans performs poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, KMeans doesn't put data points that are far away from each other into the same cluster, even when they obviously should be because they underly some obvious structure like points on a line, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div  align=\"center\"> <img src=\"images/two_lines.png\"   width=600 align=center /></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, you can see that KMeans creates the clusters in between the two lines and therefore splits each line into one of two clusters rather than classifying each line as a cluster. On the right side, you can see the DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithm, which is able to separate the two lines without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, KMeans performs poorly for complicated geometric shapes such as the moons and circles shown below.\n",

    "Other clustering algorithms like Spectral Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering, or DBSCAN don't have any problems with such data.
