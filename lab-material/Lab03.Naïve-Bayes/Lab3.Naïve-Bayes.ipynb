    "The Naïve Bayes algorithm is comprised of two words Naïve and Bayes, Which can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naïve**: It is called Naïve because it assumes that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features. Such as if the fruit is identified on the bases of color, shape, and taste, then red, spherical, and sweet fruit is recognized as an apple. Hence each feature individually contributes to identify that it is an apple without depending on each other.\n",
    "- **Bayes**: It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).\n",

    "### 1.1 Bayes' Theorem:\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color=red>In this Exercise, you are required to write your spam filter by using naïve Bayes method. This time you should not use 3rd party libraries including scikit-learn.\n",
    "DDL: week 5.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam filtering is a beginner’s example of the document classification task which involves classifying an email as spam or non-spam (a.k.a. ham) mail. An email dataset will be provided. We will use the following steps to build this application:\n",
    "1) Preparing the text data\n",
    "2) Creating a word dictionary\n",
    "3) Feature extraction\n",
    "4) Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm\n",
    "5) Training the classifier\n",
    "6) Checking the results on the test set\n",
    "### 1) Preparing the text data\n",
    "The data-set used here, is split into a training set and a test set containing 702 mails and 260 mails respectively, divided equally between spam and ham mails. You will easily recognize spam mails as it contains `spmsg` in its filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any text mining problem, text cleaning is the first step where we remove those words from the document which may not contribute to the information we want to extract.  Emails may contain a lot of undesirable characters like punctuation marks, stop words, digits, etc which may not be helpful in detecting the spam email. The emails in Ling-spam corpus have been already preprocessed in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Removal of stop words** – Stop words like “and”, “the”, “of”, etc are very common in all English sentences and are not very meaningful in deciding spam or legitimate status, so these words have been removed from the emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lemmatization** – It is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item. For example, “include”, “includes,” and “included” would all be represented as “include”. The context of the sentence is also preserved in lemmatization as opposed to stemming (another buzz word in text mining which does not consider meaning of the sentence)\n",
    "\n",
    "We still need to remove the non-words like punctuation `marks` or `special characters` from the mail documents. There are several ways to do it. Here, we will remove such words after creating a dictionary, which is a very convenient method to do so since when you have a dictionary; you need to remove every such word only once.\n",
    "### 2) Creating word dictionary\n",
    "We will only perform text analytics on the content to detect the spam mails. As the first step, we need to create a dictionary of words and their frequency. For this task, a training set of 700 mails is utilized. This python function will create the dictionary for you.\n",

Suppose we have 500 words in our dictionary. Each word count vector contains the frequency of 500 dictionary words in the training file. Suppose the text in the training file is “Get the work done, work done”, then it will be encoded as $$[0,0,0,0,0,…….0,0,2,0,0,0,……,0,0,1,0,0,…0,0,1,0,0,……2,0,0,0,0,0]$$ Here, all the word counts are placed at the 296th, 359th, 415th, 495th elements of the word count vector in the length of 500 and the rest are zero.\n",
